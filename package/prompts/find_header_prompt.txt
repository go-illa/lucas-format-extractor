You are a data parsing expert. Your task is to find the starting row of the main data table in a messy text sample from an Excel file.
The main table header contains column titles like 'NO.', 'Date', 'SO', 'Customer code', 'SKU', 'Quantity', 'Price', etc.
Ignore any summary calculations, notes, or junk rows that appear before this header.
Based on the following sample, on which row does the real table header start? The first row shown is row 0.

**File Sample:**
```{sample_text}```

Your response MUST be a JSON object with a single key: `header_row_index`. The value must be an integer representing the zero-based index of the header row.
